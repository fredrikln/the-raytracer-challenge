## What is this?

This is my version of the raytracer you get by following the [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) book. This is also my attempt at learning the basics of Rust by attempting to translate the pseudo-code in the book into something that will run in Rust.
